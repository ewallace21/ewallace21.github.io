## Drachen Flip — Animatronic Flat Ride Model (REC Competition)

Over the span of six months, I worked with the Virginia Tech Theme Park Engineering and Design Club’s Ride Engineering Competition (REC) team to design and build a fully functional scale model of a flat ride inspired by the **Huss Top Spin**. Our ride, **Drachen Flip**, was set in the ruins of an ancient temple atop a volcano. Riders were invited to steal treasure from a sleeping dragon’s hoard—but once inside, the dragon awakens, and guests must escape its wrath.

### Role and Contributions

As **subteam lead for theming electrical and controls design**, I was responsible for developing immersive show elements and integrating them with the mechanical ride system. Key contributions included:

- Designed and implemented a **motorized animatronic dragon head**, with timed jaw movements and pulsing LED eyes synced to show cues  
- Developed a **lava pit effect** using red-light-only RGB LED strips to enhance visual impact while minimizing heat output  
- Created **custom control logic** and electrical layouts for theming integration  
- Led the design and execution of **site acceptance testing** for all electrical and controls elements  

### Outcome

Our team was awarded **second place overall**, receiving outstanding marks for **site acceptance testing** and storytelling integration. This project deepened my experience in **animatronics**, **show control systems**, and **multi-disciplinary collaboration** in themed entertainment design.
