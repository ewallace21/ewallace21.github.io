## About Me

Hi, I'm **Emma Wallace**—a second-semester senior majoring in **Computer Engineering** at **Virginia Tech**, with minors in **Popular Culture** and **Mathematics**. I'm passionate about creating immersive, interactive experiences through technology, and I’m actively pursuing a career in **themed entertainment engineering**.

Growing up, I fell in love with theme parks—not just for the thrills, but for their power to bring people from all walks of life into fantastical, shared worlds. As I discovered my passion for engineering, I knew I wanted to combine that technical drive with my love for storytelling and experiential design. My goal is to design innovative, story-driven systems and technologies that elevate guest experiences in themed environments.

My engineering journey began early. I took my first technology class in middle school and continued through high school as part of the **Project Lead The Way** engineering program. In Fall 2021, I began my academic career at Virginia Tech, majoring in Computer Engineering with a primary focus on general computer engineering due to my love of **embedded systems and hardware**—areas that align naturally with the challenges of themed entertainment technology. I tailored my secondary academic focus to explore the intersection of technology, storytelling, and experience design, supported by my minors in popular culture and mathematics.

Since my freshman year, I've been an active member of Virginia Tech’s **Theme Park Engineering and Design (TPED)** club. This community has been central to my growth in the industry. In Summer 2024, I was a key contributor to our club’s qualifying round submission for the **Toronto Metropolitan University Thrill Design Competition**. Based on that work, I was selected for our six-person in-person team, where I competed in the **Safety and Accessibility Challenge**.

Inspired by that experience, I joined TPED’s team for the **2025 Ohio State Ride Engineering Competition**, where we designed *Drachen Flip*, a dragon-themed flat ride inspired by the Huss Top Spin, over the course of six months. Our team placed **second overall**, and I led the **theming electrical/controls subteam**. I engineered a fully functional **animatronic dragon head**, complete with glowing eyes and a moving jaw, and developed a **pulsing lava pit** effect using RGB LED technology—all timed and integrated into the ride’s show sequence.

My practical experience through TPED led me to spend Summer 2025 as a **Ride Operations Leadership Intern at Busch Gardens Williamsburg**, where I gained hands-on experience in daily park operations, guest interaction, ride safety, and maintenance. Working directly with operators and maintenance crews gave me a holistic view of the guest journey and operational considerations that inform successful attraction design.

With every project, I continue to explore how technology and storytelling can come together to create unforgettable experiences. I’m now looking for opportunities in themed entertainment where I can apply my technical background, creative mindset, and love for immersive experiences to make magic real for guests around the world.
