* Ohio State University Ride Engineering Competition, Virginia Tech Team: December 2024 - April 2025
  * Team awarded second place overall with outstanding marks for site acceptance testing
  * Subteam lead for theming electrical/controls design
  * Designed and implemented animatronic dragon head, with fully timed and functional jaw movements and timed pulsing LED eyes
  * Implemented pulsing lava effect with RGB LED strip, utilizing only red color to minimize heat generated
  * Developed and performed site acceptance testing for controls team and electrical theming elements

* Toronto Met University Thrill Design Competition: Fall 2024
  * Collaborated with a team to design a thrill ride based on the qualifying round prompt, contributing to the overall storyline layout for the ride, queue, and preshow experience.
  * Collaborated with a team to design a solution for the accessibility/safety challenge of the competition.
  * Led the design of accessibility features for both the queue/preshow and ride, focusing on inclusive guest experiences.
  * Created concept art for the ride vehicle and platform, incorporating wheelchair accessibility.

* Sophomore Integrated Design Project: Spring 2024
  * Collaborated with a teammate to design and develop a wireless sensor node for temperature data collection, transmitting data to a mobile device via Bluetooth.
  * Engineered the sensor node to operate independently from the power grid, utilizing solar energy (4-5V input) to charge a 9V rechargeable battery.
  * Implemented power-saving functionality, ensuring the system enters low-power mode during idle periods to conserve energy and extend the lifespan of circuit components.
